## Project Description  

This project is about developing a **Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application** to help students discover, organize, and attend events on campus. Students can browse events, save them, claim free or paid tickets, and check in using QR codes. Organizers will be able to create and manage events, track attendance, and access analytics through dashboards, while administrators will oversee accounts, moderate events, and manage organizations.  

## Specifications  

- **Frontend**: React / TypeScript  
- **Backend**: Express.js  
- **Database**: MySQL  

## Features  

Three core features (and one additional feature) will be implemented in this web app.  

### 1. Student Event Experience  
Students will be able to:  
- Browse and search events with filters (date, category, organization).  
- Save events to a personal calendar.  
- Claim tickets (free or paid).  
- Receive a unique QR-code digital ticket.  

### 2. Organizer Event Management  
Organizers will be able to:  
- Create events by entering details such as title, description, date/time, location, ticket capacity, and type.  
- Track event analytics with dashboards showing tickets issued, attendance, and capacity.  
- Export attendee lists in CSV format.  
- Validate tickets with an integrated QR scanner.  

### 3. Administrator Dashboard & Moderation  
Administrators will be able to:  
- Approve organizer accounts.  
- Moderate event listings to ensure compliance.  
- View global statistics such as number of events, tickets issued, and participation trends.  
- Manage organizations and assign roles.  

### 4. Additional Feature (TBD)  
One custom feature will also be implemented, such as:  
- **Most Popular Events**  
- **Starting Soon Events**  
- **Tailored Recommendations**
